# p5IntegrationProject
Integrates p5.js and Tone.js libraries with Arduino hardware to create a physically interactive game.

All music is made with the Tone.js library while graphics are handled with the p5.js library. Button presses are made through an Arduino Uno microcontroller board. One collects score by pressing the button which associated color matches that which is on the screen in the required time, which is in turn controlled by the difficulty level selected at the beginning. Failure to press the correct button in time results in game over and the end score being shown. Refreshing the page restarts the game.
